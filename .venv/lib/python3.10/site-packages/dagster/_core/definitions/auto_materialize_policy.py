    """An AutoMaterializePolicy specifies how Dagster should attempt to keep an asset up-to-date.

    There are two main kinds of auto-materialize policies: eager and lazy. In essence, an asset with
    an eager policy will try to immediately materialize after upstream changes, while an asset with
    a lazy policy will only materialize when necessary in order to satisfy the relevant
    FreshnessPolicies.

    For an asset / partition of an asset with an _eager_ policy to be auto-materialized, at least
    one of the following must be true:

    - it is missing
    - it has a freshness policy that requires more up-to-date data
    - any of its descendants have a freshness policy that require more up-to-date data
    - any of its parent assets / partitions have been updated more recently than it has

    For an asset / partition of an asset with a _lazy_ policy to be auto-materialized, at least one
    of the following must be true:

    - it is missing
    - it has a freshness policy that requires more up-to-date data
    - any of its descendants have a freshness policy that require more up-to-date data

    If an asset / partition meets the above criteria, then it will be auto-materialized only if none
    of the following are true:

    - any of its parent assets / partitions are missing
    - any of its ancestor assets / partitions have ancestors that have been updated more recently
        than they have

    Lastly, the `max_materializations_per_minute` parameter, which is set to 1 by default,
    rate-limits the number of auto-materializations that can occur for a particular asset within
    a short time interval. This mainly matters for partitioned assets. Its purpose is to provide a
    safeguard against "surprise backfills", where user-error causes auto-materialize to be
    accidentally triggered for large numbers of partitions at once.

    **Warning:**

    Constructing an AutoMaterializePolicy directly is not recommended as the API is subject to change.
    AutoMaterializePolicy.eager() and AutoMaterializePolicy.lazy() are the recommended API.
